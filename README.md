### Summary of Model, Accuracy, and Algorithms:

1. **Model Used:**
   - A deep learning model leveraging **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** layers was the primary choice to capture temporal dependencies in audio data.
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** were explored for spatial pattern recognition in features like MFCCs.
   - **Autoencoders** were used for anomaly detection by reconstructing input signals and comparing them to originals.

2. **Algorithm and Features:**
   - **Librosa** was used for audio feature extraction, including **MFCCs**, **Chroma Features**, and **Spectral Contrast**.
   - Data preprocessing included resampling, trimming, padding, and noise reduction.
   - Data augmentation techniques such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and background noise injection enhanced model robustness.

3. **Accuracy:**
   - Initial accuracy: 78%.
   - Post-improvement accuracy: **91%** after fine-tuning hyperparameters, enhancing data preprocessing, and adjusting the architecture.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy were used to measure model performance.
   - Cross-validation ensured generalizability, and k-fold validation enhanced robustness.
